Inhaled therapies remain the cornerstone in managing chronic airway diseases, 
offering direct treatment delivery to the lungs with minimal systemic adverse 
effects. With advancements in respiratory care, digital inhalers have emerged as 
a transformative innovation. Their functions extend beyond delivering inhaled 
medication, providing deeper insights into patients' medication use behaviour 
and intervening through complementary platform features and integrated data 
analytics. However, despite being available for over two decades, the widespread 
adoption of digital inhaler platforms remains limited due to uncertainties 
regarding their cost-effectiveness, feasibility in real-world settings, and 
concerns regarding sustainability. Identifying patient groups that could benefit 
most from these technologies and designing strategies for effective deployment 
across diverse healthcare contexts is important. To achieve this, bridging the 
gap between innovation and accessibility is required so that digital inhaler 
platforms evolve into inclusive, patient-centred tools rather than niche 
technologies. This narrative review provides a summary of the evolution and 
current landscape of digital inhaler technology, its impact on clinical outcomes 
in chronic airway disease, and key challenges that stakeholders should address 
for the successful integration of these tools into respiratory care. We also 
propose key components of a patient-centred digital inhaler adherence support 
model that prioritises accessibility and efficacy.

Pulmonary complications are a major cause of morbidity following pediatric 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, 
longitudinal pulmonary function test (PFT) trajectories and early predictors of 
dysfunction, particularly the interplay between underlying disease, PFTs, and 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), remain poorly understood. In this 
retrospective single-center study, we analyzed 233 children undergoing their 
first allo-HSCT with ≥ 100-day survival. Patients were categorized into benign 
(acquired aplastic anemia, n = 142) and malignant (leukemia/lymphoma, n = 91) 
groups. We assessed longitudinal PFTs over 24 months and used Kaplan-Meier and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify early predictors 
(including 3-month PFT values and GVHD) for subsequent Obstructive (OVD) and 
Restrictive Ventilatory Disorders (RVD). Over a median follow-up of 33.1 months, 
the malignant group exhibited significantly slower FEV1 recovery, greater 
severity of RVD (P = 0.006) and diffusion impairment (P = 0.040), and higher 
cumulative incidences of OVD (HR = 3.34, P = 0.013) and RVD (HR = 2.16, 
P = 0.013). The malignant group also had significantly higher rates of acute 
(P < 0.001) and chronic GVHD (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the 
strongest independent predictors for RVD were lower 3-month FVC%pred (OR = 0.85, 
P < 0.001) and the presence of chronic GVHD (OR = 5.97, P = 0.027). For OVD, 
predictors were lower 3-month MEF50%pred (OR = 0.95, P = 0.030), acute GVHD 
(OR = 4.24, P = 0.014), and chronic GVHD (OR = 4.20, P = 0.018). Children with 
malignant diseases face a higher burden of post-HSCT pulmonary dysfunction, 
driven by both the underlying disease/treatment intensity and a higher incidence 
of GVHD. Early post-transplant PFTs (FVC%pred, MEF50%pred) and the development 
of GVHD are powerful, independent predictors of long-term ventilatory disorders. 
These findings underscore the need for routine, stratified longitudinal 
monitoring to facilitate early risk stratification and intervention.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are the two leading causes of death in the world. Studies show a 
close mutually aggravating relationship between arterial hypertension (AH) and 
COPD. Antihypertensive therapy in patients with AH and COPD has a number of 
features, aiming to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular complications 
and mortality from CVD without worsening lung function.
AIM: To analyze the data of patients with AH and COPD included in the national 
registry to determine the burden of CVD risk factors, concomitant 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease, obesity, 
diabetes mellitus, gout and characteristics of antihypertensive therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative analysis of patients of the hypertension 
registry (conducted in outpatient clinics) was performed depending on the 
presence (n=3323) or absence (n=54073) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Statistical analysis of the obtained data were performed using the R 4.3.3 
statistical computing environment (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS: The prevalence of COPD in patients with hypertension was 5.8% (3323 
cases). The presence of COPD in patients with hypertension, regardless of gender 
and age, was statistically significantly associated with higher odds of having 
coronary artery disease [odds ratio (OR) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
2.06-2.38; p<0.001], a history of myocardial infarction (OR 1.73, 95% CI 
1.59-1.87; p<0.001), chronic heart failure (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.82-2.1; p<0.001), 
a history of acute cerebrovascular accident (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.46; 
p=0.004), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.31-3.59; p<0.001), atrial 
fibrillation (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.45-1.93; p<0.001). Patients with hypertension 
and COPD more often received drugs from the group of angiotensin-II receptor 
antagonists than patients with hypertension without COPD (22.7% vs 17.7%). The 
prescription of drugs from the group of beta-blockers in patients with 
hypertension and COPD was lower by 4%. Cardiovascular risk factors, 
comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, gout, obstructive sleep apnea in 
patients with hypertension and COPD are more common.
CONCLUSION: Patients with COPD and hypertension have a higher incidence of risk 
factors, CVD and comorbid pathologies. They require closer attention during 
examination and during the selection of antihypertensive therapy. In patients 
with hypertension and COPD, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and 
beta-blockers are prescribed less frequently than in patients with hypertension 
without COPD due to possible side effects and contraindications.

Publisher: Актуальность. Сердечно-сосудистые заболевания (ССЗ) и хроническая 
обструктивная болезнь легких (ХОБЛ) – две основные причины смерти в мире. 
Исследования показывают тесную взаимоотягчающую связь артериальной гипертонии 
(АГ) и ХОБЛ. Антигипертензивная терапия (АГТ) у больных АГ и ХОБЛ имеет ряд 
особенностей, ее цель – снижение риска развития сердечно-сосудистых осложнений и 
смертности от ССЗ без ухудшения функции легких. Цель. Проанализировать данные 
больных АГ и ХОБЛ, включенных в национальный регистр, для определения 
отягощенности факторами сердечно-сосудистого риска (ССР), сопутствующими ССЗ, 
цереброваскулярными заболеваниями и хронической болезнью почек, ожирением, 
сахарным диабетом, подагрой, а также особенностей АГТ. Материалы и методы. 
Выполнен сравнительный анализ пациентов регистра АГ (проводился в 
амбулаторно-поликлинических учреждениях) в зависимости от наличия (n=3323) или 
отсутствия (n=54 073) ХОБЛ. Статистический анализ полученных данных проводили с 
использованием среды для статистических вычислений R 4.3.3 (R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing, Вена, Австрия). Результаты. Распространенность ХОБЛ у 
пациентов с АГ составила 5,8% (3323 случая). Наличие ХОБЛ у пациентов с АГ вне 
зависимости от пола и возраста было статистически значимо ассоциировано с более 
высокими шансами ишемической болезни сердца [отношение шансов (ОШ) 2,21, 95% 
доверительный интервал (ДИ) 2,06–2,38; p<0,001], инфаркта миокарда в анамнезе 
(ОШ 1,73, 95% ДИ 1,59–1,87; p<0,001), хронической сердечной недостаточности (ОШ 
1,95, 95% ДИ 1,82–2,1; p<0,001), острого нарушения мозгового кровообращения в 
анамнезе (ОШ 1,25, 95% ДИ 1,07–1,46; p=0,004), транзиторной ишемической атаки 
(ОШ 2,9, 95% ДИ 2,31–3,59; p<0,001), фибрилляции предсердий (ОШ 1,68, 95% ДИ 
1,45–1,93; p<0,001). Больные АГ и ХОБЛ по сравнению с больными АГ без 
сопутствующей ХОБЛ чаще получали препараты из группы антагонистов рецепторов к 
ангиотензину II (22,7% vs 17,7%). Препараты из группы b-адреноблокаторов больным 
АГ и ХОБЛ назначали реже на 4%, чем больным АГ без ХОБЛ. Факторы ССР, 
сопутствующие заболевания, такие как сахарный диабет, подагра, обструктивное 
апноэ сна, у больных АГ и ХОБЛ встречались чаще. Заключение. Пациенты с ХОБЛ и 
АГ имеют большую частоту факторов риска ССЗ и коморбидных патологий. Они требуют 
более пристального внимания при обследовании и во время подбора АГТ. Пациентам с 
АГ и ХОБЛ ингибиторы ангиотензинпревращающего фермента и b-адреноблокаторы 
назначают реже, чем пациентам с АГ без ХОБЛ, из-за возможных побочных эффектов и 
противопоказаний.

Medicine, Allergology, and Palliative Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

IntroductionUse of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for more than 15 h per day 
does not reduce mortality or hospitalizations, but may increase the risk of 
adverse events. We evaluated the relationship between daily oxygen use duration 
and adverse events, symptoms, and health status in patients on LTOT.MethodsThis 
was a cross-sectional survey study of a random sample (N = 650) of adults with 
ongoing LTOT in Sweden. Oxygen use (h/day) was reported, and associations were 
analyzed with adverse events, symptom severities (revised Edmonton Symptom 
Assessment System), sleep duration and quality, and health status (COPD 
assessment test [CAT]).ResultsIn total, surveys from 204 patients were analyzed; 
60% female, mean age 75.3 (SD 8.7) years. Swedevox baseline characteristics were 
similar between sampled respondents and non-respondents. Patients reporting 24 h 
of daily oxygen use (53.4%) also reported a higher number of total adverse 
events, higher ratings of dyspnea, depression and anxiety, and worse health 
status, compared to those reporting fewer hours of oxygen use. A longer daily 
duration of oxygen use also associated with a higher number of experienced 
adverse events, higher ratings of dyspnea and anxiety, and worse rated health 
status in crude and adjusted linear regression models. No associations were seen 
between oxygen use duration and sleep quality or duration.ConclusionMore adverse 
events, a higher severity of some symptoms, and worse health status are seen 
among patients with a longer daily duration of oxygen use. Further research is 
needed to establish evidence of causality.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine became crucial for 
monitoring chronic conditions, including respiratory diseases.
OBJECTIVES: This study, part of a larger cohort of COVID-positive patients, 
focuses on individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
monitored through an active home surveillance system (COD19).
DESIGN: Longitudinal telematic active surveillance study.
METHODS: The study included COVID-19-positive patients in home isolation, 
quarantined workers, and those discharged from ASST hospitals or emergency 
departments. At discharge, patients received a letter with isolation guidelines, 
a COD19 kit (oxygen meter, thermometer, protective devices), and instructions 
for monitoring clinical parameters. Regular phone check-ins by physicians were 
conducted, starting within 12 h of activation. A secure platform COD19 enabled 
data collection and communication between patients, healthcare providers, and 
regional authorities.
RESULTS: The study involved 1288 patients, including 226 (17.5%) with COPD, who 
were older (p < 0.001), had a higher BMI (p = 0.006), and were more frequently 
admitted from home isolation (p < 0.001). COPD patients also had higher mean 
body temperature (p = 0.011) and respiratory rate (p = 0.035), with a 
non-significant trend toward lower SpO2 values. Monitoring outcomes indicated 
that COPD patients were more likely to require higher levels of care 
(p < 0.001), and the only two deceased patients were from this group. The remote 
monitoring service received positive feedback, with a median answering ratio of 
92%, reflecting strong patient participation and manageable monitoring 
processes.
CONCLUSION: The findings underscore telemedicine's effectiveness in COPD 
management, ensuring continuity of care and smooth home-to-hospital transitions. 
The system enhanced accessibility, enabling consistent monitoring and timely 
interventions. As healthcare evolves, telemedicine remains a key tool in 
improving patient care and accessibility.

Kidneys are functionally affected by the diseases of other organs. Here, we 
present an elderly predialysis patient with a functioning kidney for 10 years of 
nephrological follow-up despite many comorbidities. A 75-year-old male patient 
with a medical history of hypertension for 15 years and 60 pack years of 
cigarette smoking, was diagnosed as muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and 
synchronous centrally located clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in the 
left kidney. At admission, the patient had an Estimated Glomerular Filtration 
Rate (eGFR) (CKD-EPI-cre) of 54mL/min/1.73m2, after left nephrectomy eGFR of the 
patient decreased to 35 mL/min/1.73m2. After ten years of follow-up, the 
patient's right kidney had been functional with a eGFR of 24 mL/min/1.73m2 
despite radical cystectomy with urinary diversion, radical nephrectomy, heavy 
smoking, [cardiorenal syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
hypertension. It is well known that comorbidities such as hypertension, smoking, 
cancers, infections, pulmonary and heart diseases contribute to irreversible 
kidney damage and are additive to decreasing kidney function. Appropriate and 
early diagnosis and treatment of these comorbidities permit healthy aging of the 
kidneys without the need for dialysis.

Herein, we report a case of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 
complicated by Strongyloides stercoralis infection. A 73-year-old man with a 
history of duodenal ulcer perforation and prior Billroth II gastrectomy 
presented with a 14-year history of recurrent cough and wheezing, recently 
accompanied by new gastrointestinal symptoms. He was initially diagnosed with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subsequent laboratory evaluation 
revealed a markedly elevated total serum IgE (1,219 kUA/L) and increased 
Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE (0.38 kUA/L, positive cutoff >0.35 kUA/L), 
leading to a diagnosis of ABPA. Despite antifungal and corticosteroid therapy, 
total IgE levels remained persistently elevated, accompanied by worsening 
gastrointestinal symptoms. Multiple stool examinations failed to detect 
parasitic infection. As gastrointestinal symptoms progressed, gastroscopy 
revealed the presence of parasitic eggs and larvae. Subsequently, a stool 
specimen was sent to the Xiamen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Using 
the formol-ether concentration technique, the microscopic examination ultimately 
confirmed an infection with Strongyloides stercoralis. Following albendazole 
treatment, the patient's symptoms completely resolved. In conclusion, 
co-infection of ABPA with Strongyloides stercoralis may lead to missed or 
delayed diagnosis due to persistently elevated IgE levels.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of patients who are discharged from hospital for 
an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) are readmitted within 30 days. Prediction 
scores are helpful to identify those who are at higher risk of readmission, such 
that they can be prioritized for readmission-reducing interventions.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and determine the accuracy and precision of a clinical 
prediction model using data available in electronic medical records to predict 
30-day readmission in patients discharged after a hospitalization with an 
AECOPD.
METHODS: A dataset was created using all admissions to General Internal Medicine 
from 2012 to 2018 at seven hospitals in Toronto, Canada. We fit and internally 
validated models with six algorithms.
RESULTS: Of the 16,314 patients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD, 15.4% 
were readmitted at 30 days. Top-performing models included LASSO, logistic 
regression, linear discriminant analysis, and XGBoost with C-statistics of 0.688 
± 0.024, 0.690 ± 0.026, 0.687 ± 0.023, and 0.686 ± 0.022. The four top models 
had similarly high specificity (96%-98%) with poor sensitivity (14%-20%) at a 
decision threshold of 50%. At a more aggressive decision threshold of 20%, 
specificity was less (69%-73%) with a modest improvement in sensitivity 
(55%-59%). The most important predictor of readmission risk was the number of 
hospitalizations in the previous year.
CONCLUSION: We generated clinical prediction models to predict all-cause 30-day 
readmissions after an acute exacerbation using data from 7 hospitals' electronic 
medical records. Further work should be done to improve performance, especially 
sensitivity.

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate SYNTAX Score II for its ability to predict 
mortality in all-comers undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.
METHODS: External validation of SYNTAX Score II was performed in a retrospective 
analysis of 2 tertiary care centers. Mortality at 4 years after surgery was 
defined as the primary outcome variable. External validation included assessment 
of calibration (calibration-in-the-large, observed-expected ratio, calibration 
slope) and discrimination (concordance statistic, Receiver Operating 
Characteristic curve). Additionally, SYNTAX Score II's performance was compared 
with the performance of EuroSCORE II, the logistic EuroSCORE, and ACEF Score.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 1454 patients (Medical University of Vienna, 
n = 782; Medical University of Innsbruck, n = 672). Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
showed that tertiles of SYNTAX Score II were significantly associated with 
mortality (log-rank test, p < 0.001). In a stratified multivariable Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model, the following score components were 
independently associated with mortality: age (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence 
interval 1.00 to 1.06), creatinine clearance (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence 
interval 0.97 to 0.99), left-ventricular ejection fraction (hazard ratio 0.97, 
95% confidence interval 0.95 to 0.98), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(hazard ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 3.05). The anatomical SYNTAX 
Score was not independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% 
confidence interval 0.98 to 1.02). Assessment of SYNTAX Score II calibration 
revealed an observed-expected ratio of 0.61 and a calibration slope of 0.62 
(p < 0.001 for comparison with slope = 1.0), indicating general overestimation 
of 4-year mortality. The c-statistic amounted to 0.73. Performance of SYNTAX 
Score II was comparable with the performance of EuroSCORE II (c-statistic 0.73), 
the logistic EuroSCORE (c-statistic 0.74) and ACEF Score (c-statistic 0.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that SYNTAX Score II has acceptable 
discriminative strength with respect to 4-year mortality in all-comers 
undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. Notably, mortality is 
over-estimated in patients with higher SYNTAX Score II values. SYNTAX Score II, 
EuroSCORE II, the logistic EuroSCORE, and ACEF Score offer comparable predictive 
value towards 4-year mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding patient perspectives on asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is limited, with no prior studies employing 
such a large-scale, proactive survey to systematically target individuals with a 
confirmed prescription for inhalation medication. This study aims to explore how 
patients with asthma or COPD manage their lives, including treatment 
experiences, symptoms and impacts on daily life.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A nationwide survey will be launched in January 2025, 
targeting adults (≥18 years) in Denmark diagnosed with asthma or COPD and 
prescribed or dispensed inhalation medication between 1 October 2023 and 30 
September 2024. Data from the Danish Health Data Authority's Register of 
Medicinal Product Statistics will identify eligible individuals. The electronic 
survey will be distributed via e-Boks to approximately 450 000 individuals.The 
questionnaire integrates validated tools-COPD Assessment Test, Modified Medical 
Research Council scale, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level and Asthma Control 
Test-alongside expert-developed questions on symptoms, diagnosis, disease 
control, treatment and patient experiences. Questionnaire development included 
10 cognitive interviews with patients from the Outpatient Clinic at Vejle 
Hospital.Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse both continuous and 
categorical data, with sensitivity analyses conducted as well. Data management 
will be handled in Research Electronic Data Capture, and statistical analyses 
will be performed using Stata V.18.0.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is registered with the Danish Data 
Protection Agency (24/5229) and Open Patient Data Explorative Network (OP_2094) 
and follows the Declaration of Helsinki. Results will be published in 
peer-reviewed journals, presented at national and international conferences and 
shared through patient associations.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: COPD, marked by coughing, sputum production, and 
wheezing, is categorized as ""Lung Distension"" in Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(TCM). The combined use of Suzi Jiangqi Decoction and Sanzi Yangqin Decoction, 
known as Jia Wei Su Zi Jiang Qi Formula (JWSZJQF), is a common treatment for 
Lung Distension with phlegm accumulation in the lungs. It is particularly 
effective for symptoms like excessive phlegm and chest tightness. However, the 
specific active components of JWSZJQF and their molecular mechanisms in 
addressing mucus hypersecretion in COPD remain unclear, requiring further 
investigation and validation.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to identify the potential targets and 
signaling pathways of JWSZJQF in treating COPD-associated mucus hypersecretion 
using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS, network pharmacology, and in vitro experimental 
verification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All plant names were verified through WorldFloraOnline 
(www.worldFloraonline.org) and MPNs (http://mpns.kew.org). First, the effective 
components of JWSZJQF were identified and analyzed using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS, 
supplemented by data from TCMSP. Network pharmacology analysis was used to 
determine the potential targets and pathways of JWSZJQF in COPD treatment. A 
mucus hypersecretion cell model was created using IL-17 cytokine, and the 
effectiveness of JWSZJQF in reducing mucus hypersecretion was assessed through 
immunofluorescence assay, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lastly, a prospective study was conducted to 
collect data from 30 inpatients with AECOPD between September 2023 and July 
2024. Serum samples before and after treatment were analyzed to validate the 
findings.
RESULTS: A total of 864 active components were identified, with 79 potential 
COPD therapeutic targets confirmed based on the top 30 active components, 
including TNF, IL-6, and AKT1. The involved KEGG pathways included the IL-17 and 
NF-κB signaling pathways. In vitro experiments showed that JWSZJQF inhibited 
mucin (MUC5AC) secretion at both mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, JWSZJQF 
modulated i-κBα and p65 expression in the NF-κB pathway. Compared to the control 
group, patients treated with JWSZJQF exhibited lower levels of IL-17 and MUC5AC 
in their serum.
CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily explored the mechanisms of JWSZJQF in 
treating COPD-associated mucus hypersecretion through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS, 
network pharmacology, in vitro experiments, and clinical observation. The main 
active components and potential targets were identified, laying a scientific 
foundation for further research.

OBJECTIVE: To study the COVID-19 disease course in people living with HIV (PLWH) 
based on meaningful case numbers, information about comorbidities, 
antiretroviral and COVID-19 treatment and HIV disease-related variables.
METHODS: Multi-centre, observational, retrospective study of people living with 
HIV with COVID-19 matched to HIV-uninfected individuals with COVID-19 (HUC) and 
a case-control study of people living with HIV with COVID-19 matched to COVID-19 
negative people living with HIV. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox 
proportional-hazards models stratified on each matched pair were used for 
COVID-19 outcomes, and conditional logistic regression models were used to 
identify risk factors for COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: Five hundred people living with HIV and COVID-19, 1106 HUC and 992 
people living with HIV without COVID-19 were included. Rates for chronic kidney 
disease, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, prior pneumonia and liver 
disease in people living with HIV with COVID-19 were significantly higher by 
4.1-, 2.9-, 2.6-, 2.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared to HIV seronegative 
COVID-19 patients. Chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention stage B versus A and HIV viral load ≥50 copies/mL were significant 
risk factors for COVID-19 in people living with HIV. Critical care admission or 
death in people living with HIV was comparable to HUC, whilst people living with 
HIV stayed longer in hospital (11 vs. 9 days) and in intensive care unit (ICU) 
(18 vs. 7 days) and had a higher age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of a well-controlled HIV 
infection to prevent severe COVID-19-related outcomes. In people living with HIV 
and COVID-19, chronic kidney disease and a higher Charlson comorbidity index are 
risk factors that should prompt early treatment of COVID-19.

Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) has evolved significantly over the past 
decade. While initially used primarily for neuromuscular diseases, the 
increasing application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) has demonstrated significant benefits in reducing 
mortality and hospitalizations. Concurrently, the prevalence of obesity 
hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is rising, necessitating adapted treatment 
strategies. The newly updated German S3-guideline differentiates between NIV and 
invasive ventilation and includes refined indication criteria, particularly for 
COPD. Furthermore, it incorporates ethical considerations regarding 
decision-making in ventilation therapy and end of life. Alternative treatment 
options for chronic respiratory insufficiency are also gaining clinical and 
scientific attention. High flow therapy, which is already being used effectively 
for acute respiratory insufficiency, is increasingly being used for chronic 
respiratory insufficiency. Furthermore, the implementation of the Intensive Care 
and Rehabilitation Strengthening Act (IPREG) has established new quality 
standards in long-term mechanical ventilation, yet challenges persist in its 
nationwide application.

Publisher: Die nicht invasive Beatmung (NIV) gewinnt zunehmend an Bedeutung in 
der Therapie der chronischen respiratorischen Insuffizienz, insbesondere bei 
COPD-Patient*innen. Der Anstieg der NIV-beatmeten Patient*innen ist auf die 
zunehmende Evidenz zur Wirksamkeit dieser Therapieform zurückzuführen.Der 
medizinische Fortschritt sowie zunehmend komplexere Indikationsstellungen 
machten es notwendig, die Leitlinie zur nicht invasiven Beatmung bei chronisch 
respiratorischer Insuffizienz von derjenigen zur invasiven Beatmung zu trennen. 
Zudem wurden neue ethische Richtlinien zur Entscheidungsfindung bei der 
Einleitung und Beendigung der Beatmungstherapie in der Leitlinie 
implementiert.Die Entscheidung zwischen ambulanter und stationärer Kontrolle 
sollte auf der Grundlage klar definierter Behandlungsalgorithmen getroffen 
werden. Die Überprüfung der Beatmungseffektivität, die Erfassung des 
Patient*innen-Komforts, die Bewertung der Symptomlast sowie die Analyse der 
Gerätenutzung und -handhabung tragen zur Entscheidung bei.Das Intensivpflege- 
und Rehabilitationsstärkungsgesetz (IPREG) setzt neue Standards für die 
Qualitätssicherung und fördert das Weaning bei invasiv beatmeten Patient*innen; 
hier bestehen allerdings noch Kapazitätsengpässe, um die neuen Empfehlungen 
adäquat umzusetzen.Neue Leitlinien präzisieren Indikationskriterien und betonen 
die Rolle der High-Intensity-NIV. Die Versorgung von Patient*innen mit 
Obesitas-Hypoventilationssyndrom (OHS) wurde durch aktualisierte 
Therapie-Algorithmen optimiert. Die nasale High-Flow-Therapie (HFT) zeigt sich 
als vielversprechende zusätzliche Therapie-Option – auch bei chronisch 
respiratorischer Insuffizienz. Die Datenlage hierzu ist allerdings noch 
unzureichend, sodass aktuell keine Empfehlung hierzu ausgesprochen werden kann.

BACKGROUND: COPD phenotyping is an approach for developing tailored therapies. 
The eosinophilic phenotype is associated with exacerbation risk and response to 
specific treatments. This study evaluates the relationship between sputum and 
blood eosinophilia, hypothesizing that sputum eosinophil percentage (SpE%) 
better reflects disease severity and exacerbation risk than blood eosinophil 
counts (BEC).
METHODS: A single-center, prospective observational cohort enrolled 107 
participants aged 40-80 with clinically diagnosed COPD. Participants completed 
spirometry, a 6-minute walk test, and questionnaires, and blood and sputum 
samples were provided at baseline and 3 months. BEC and SpE% were measured via 
routine complete blood counts and flow cytometric analyses (FACS). Eosinophilic 
phenotype thresholds were defined as BEC≥300 cells/μL and SpE%≥2%, and 
associations with clinical characteristics and outcomes were investigated.
RESULTS: Adequate sputum specimens were obtained less frequently than blood 
(60.7% vs 98%). SpE% showed poor repeatability (interclass coefficient 0.36) and 
poor correlation with FACS (Spearman's 𝜌=0.008, p=0.58). Conversely, BEC showed 
higher repeatability (𝜌=0.67, p<0.01) and better correlation with FACS (𝜌=0.74, 
p<0.01). More participants were classified as eosinophilic COPD by sputum 
(33.3%) than by blood (19.6%). BEC values were poorly correlated with SpE% 
(𝜌=0.13, P=0.39), and sputum and blood-based diagnostic criteria showed poor 
agreement (64.5%, Cohen's 𝜅 0.10). High SpE%, but not high BEC, was associated 
with lower FEV1 % predicted.
CONCLUSIONS: In stable COPD patients, BEC and SpE% did not correlate well, and 
blood- and sputum-based diagnostic criteria identified different individuals. 
Defining eosinophilic COPD requires a better understanding of the biocompartment 
sampled, testing methods, and cut-off values used.

Chronic inflammation is a crucial driver in the development of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its comorbidities, such as skeletal 
muscle dysfunction. Heightened IL-36 expression in the lung and systemic 
circulation has been observed in patients with COPD, but the potential role of 
IL-36 in COPD still needs further exploration. Herein, we established a COPD 
model through long-term cigarette smoke (CS) exposure in mice with or without 
IL-36R deletion. Elevated IL-36 cytokines were observed in the lung and 
peripheral blood of CS-exposed wild-type mice. IL-36R gene deficiency attenuated 
CS-induced lung parenchymal destruction and airway inflammation, as evidenced by 
decreased secretion of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and 
MMP9, and a diminished Th1/Tc1- and Tfh-biased immune response. In addition, 
skeletal muscle dysfunction was alleviated in CS-exposed mice by IL-36R 
deletion. Further investigations indicated that CS treatment induced the 
expression of IL-36 cytokines and IL-36R in C2C12 myotubes and skeletal muscles, 
and that IL-36 cytokines could upregulate FBXO32 and TRIM63 expression by 
activating NF-κB p65 pathway, thereby leading to skeletal muscle atrophy in an 
endocrine and autocrine/paracrine manner. Our findings provide evidence for a 
critical role of the IL-36/IL-36R signaling in the pathogenesis of CS-induced 
COPD and comorbid skeletal muscle dysfunction.

Drug discovery is a costly and time-intensive process that is often limited by 
efficacy issues and unforeseen side effects. GPCR-targeting ligands, which 
account for one-third of marketed drugs, have been shown to exhibit biased 
signaling and preferential activation of one signaling pathway over another. 
While designing biased ligands is a recent advancement, their therapeutic 
benefits remain uncertain. However, the success of existing drugs raises the 
following question: do they inherently exhibit signaling bias that enhances 
efficacy or safety? This study examines the signaling profiles of short- and 
long-acting β2AR agonists (SABAs and LABAs), key treatments for asthma and COPD, 
using biosensors to measure G protein and β-arrestin coupling. Older SABAs, such 
as isoprenaline and isoetharine, show minor G protein bias, while newer agents, 
such as salbutamol, demonstrate significant G protein bias. Among LABAs, 
salmeterol shows greater G protein bias compared to that of the more balanced 
formoterol. This shift toward G protein bias over 50 years reflects efforts to 
improve asthma treatments. The increased bias results from reduced 
ligand-receptor residence times and weaker receptor-β-arrestin complex 
formation, contributing to the enhanced efficacy. Despite the potential 
advantages, a systematic evaluation of signaling bias remains underutilized in 
drug development. Early-stage, high-throughput tools to assess signaling 
profiles could improve candidate selection, reduce late-stage failures, and 
minimize side effects. We advocate for the routine integration of biosensors for 
quantifying signaling bias, optimizing compound selection, and enhancing 
therapeutic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Concurrent pulmonary diseases are common in patients with 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, whether GERD increase the 
incidence of pulmonary diseases is uncertain because of a lack of quantitative 
evidence. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether GERD was associated 
with the increased incidence of subsequent of pulmonary diseases.
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were 
searched through 12 July 2024. The primary outcomes were asthma and pneumonia, 
and the secondary outcomes were pulmonary fibrosis (PF), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
bronchiectasis, bronchitis, acute lung injury (ALI), pulmonary embolism, 
pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease 
(NTMPD). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated 
to investigate the associations of prior GERD with the incidence of pulmonary 
diseases, and subgroup analyses based on the treatment of GERD, age and source 
of OR were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 45 cohort studies were included. The pooled results 
indicated that GERD was significantly linked to an increased incidence of asthma 
(OR = 1.50, P < 0.001) and pneumonia (OR = 1.53, P < 0.001), as did PF (OR = 
1.43, P = 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.41, P = 0.004), lung cancer (OR = 1.51, P < 
0.001), ILD (OR = 1.28, P = 0.015), bronchiectasis (OR = 1.63, P = 0.039), 
bronchitis (OR = 1.24, P < 0.001), ALI (OR = 2.07, P < 0.001), pulmonary 
embolism (OR = 1.33, P = 0.013), PTB (OR = 1.63, P = 0.015) and NTMPD (OR = 
3.36, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses stratified by age and source of OR yielded 
similar results. However, no significant associations between treated GERD and 
the incidence of asthma (OR = 1.27, P = 0.081) or lung cancer (OR = 1.01, P = 
0.97) were observed.
CONCLUSION: The presence of GERD is associated with an increased incidence of 
subsequent various pulmonary diseases, but regular treatment may eliminate this 
effect. These findings highlight the importance of screening and management for 
pulmonary diseases and of standardized therapy in patients with GERD.

BACKGROUND: Chronic respiratory disease is currently the third most common cause 
of death worldwide and is associated with reduced quality of life, anxiety, and 
depression. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of 
spiritual care programs on anxiety and quality of life of chronic respiratory 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This semi-experimental study was conducted on chronic 
respiratory patients in 2023 at Shahid Modares Hospital in Saveh city. The 
spiritual care program was held during five consecutive sessions for 2 hours for 
the test group. All patients completed the pretest, and then 1 month after the 
end of the intervention, they were evaluated in terms of anxiety and quality of 
life. Block randomization method was used to allocate patients.
RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between situational anxiety and 
all demographic variables. A significant relationship was found between trait 
anxiety and gender, insurance, and history of surgery. The results showed that 
there is a significant relationship between different dimensions of quality of 
life with some demographic variables such as age, income, gender, and history of 
surgery. The score of situational and trait anxiety in the test and control 
groups did not show a significant difference after the intervention (P value = 
0.09), but this difference was significant in the case of trait anxiety (P value 
= 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The correct inclusion of spirituality in the daily clinical routine 
can reduce patients' anxiety and have significant positive effects on patients 
by creating comfort, increasing adherence to treatment and improving quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND: The therapeutic application of dietary polyphenols in chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management represents an emerging 
therapeutic paradigm in pulmonary medicine. As bioactive compounds exhibiting 
dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, polyphenolic derivatives 
demonstrate significant therapeutic potential through multimodal mechanisms 
targeting COPD pathophysiology - particularly in modulating redox homeostasis 
(GSH/GSSG ratio elevation), attenuating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascades, 
and enhancing respiratory function parameters (FEV1 improvement ≥12% from 
baseline). However, current clinical evidence remains inconclusive, with 
meta-analyses revealing heterogeneity in intervention outcomes across randomized 
controlled trials. This systematic investigation employs a triple-blind, 
placebo-controlled design to rigorously evaluate the clinical efficacy of 
standardized oral polyphenol supplementation in COPD patients (GOLD stages 
II-III), incorporating advanced biomarkers including 8-isoprostane 
quantification and pulmonary function trajectory analysis.
METHODS: Literature on dietary polyphenols for the treatment of COPD published 
in PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, CNKI and other databases before December 26, 2024 
(in Chinese and English) was searched. Manual screening, quality assessment and 
data extraction of search results were performed in strict accordance with the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 
software.
RESULTS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in this review 
examined dietary supplementation with eight polyphenols-curcumin, resveratrol, 
anthocyanins, quercetin, salidroside, dietary beetroot juice, pomegranate juice, 
and adjunctive oral AKL1 treatment-across a total of 894 participants. This 
systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that, compared to a placebo; ① 
Curcumin significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) and improved 
FEV1(SMD=-0.82, 95%CI -1.53 to -0.11); ② Salidroside was effective in reducing 
thrombotic markers (TT, D-D), inflammatory factors (TNF-α) and symptom scores 
(CAT) (p<0.01); ③ Resveratrol significantly downregulates serum TNF-α and IL-8 
levels (p=0.003); ④ Anthocyanins may accelerate lung function decline (decreased 
FEV1/FVC, which needs to be interpreted with caution); ⑤ Other polyphenols 
(quercetin, pomegranate juice, AKL1, etc.) did not show significant efficacy or 
insufficient evidence. It is worth noting that the overall meta-analysis of some 
indicators (such as FEV1/FVC) did not reach statistical significance, but 
subgroup analysis suggested the potential value of specific polyphenols.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review confirms that the efficacy of dietary 
polyphenols is significantly composition-specific. Curcumin and salidroside can 
improve the course of COPD by regulating blood pressure, inflammation, and the 
coagulation pathway, supporting the hypothesis of ""polyphenol targeting of 
metabolic-inflammatory networks"". However, the possible negative effects of 
anthocyanins warn against ingredient heterogeneity. Clinical significance: 
Curcumin (200-500 mg/day) and tanshinone are recommended as adjuvant treatment 
options for COPD, but blind combination should be avoided; the safety of 
ingredients such as quercetin needs to be further verified. These results 
provide graded evidence for personalized nutritional interventions, promoting 
the transformation of polyphenol preparations from dietary supplements to 
precision adjuvant therapies.

This report presents a case of Infective Endocarditis (IE) caused by 
Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). The E. faecalis isolates were sensitive to 
ampicillin, penicillin G, and vancomycin. However, the outcome of anti-infection 
therapy was poor, and the patient was suspected to be allergic to vancomycin and 
ampicillin-sulbactam. This prompted various changes in antibiotic treatment 
regimens, with the patient eventually cured after administration of penicillin G 
combined with ceftriaxone (PC regimen). Literature was retrieved from the CNKI, 
Wanfang, Weipu, and PubMed databases to determine the efficacy of the PC regimen 
in the treatment of E. faecalis-induced IE. From the literature retrieved and 
our case study, there were only five reports of cases that had been treated with 
the PC regimen, with a mean age of (61.6 ± 17.2) years. The cases that had been 
previously reported in the literature involved patients of advanced age with 
complicated underlying diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), atrial valve replacement, bladder carcinoma, and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin against the 
E. faecalis isolates from all five patients was <2 μg/ml, and all isolates 
showed susceptibility to penicillin G. All five patients were initially treated 
with other antimicrobial regimens but were eventually cured after switching to 
the PC regimen. In conclusion, ampicillin combined with ceftriaxone (AC regimen) 
can be substituted with the PC regimen for the treatment of IE caused by 
penicillin-susceptible E.faecalis when ampicillin is not available, when 
outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) with an AC regimen is not 
feasible, or when the patient is allergic to ampicillin.
